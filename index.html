						CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
						physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
						at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
						venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
					</p>
					<p>
						He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
						particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
						discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
						potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
						have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
						repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
						of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
					</p>
					<p>
						If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
						heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
						mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
						irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
						diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
					</p>
					<p>
						“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
						and drew a double box around it.
					</p>
					<p>
						On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
						that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
						hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
					</p>
					<p>
						Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
						cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
						led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
						Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
						so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
						wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
						trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
						smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
						colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

					<p>
						Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
						many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
					</p>
					<p>
						If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
						science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
						the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
						realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
						14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
						galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
						extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
						own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
						bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
						over.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section-title">‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
					<p>
						In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
						operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
						accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
						Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
						gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
						general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
						expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as
						it gets.”
					</p>
					<p>
						He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
						sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
					</p>
					<p>
						The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
						of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
						of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
						surface of the sun.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
						Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
						reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
						Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
						Astrophysical Journal.

							<strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years old.
							From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere
							that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a
							mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough
							for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the
							universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for
							scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using
							a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup,
							and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and
							how much it has cooled.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look a mile
							in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly
							the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar
							cup in every direction, you might want to look for another
							explanation.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been enough
							time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get
							cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single
							coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even
							temperature.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory
							proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big
							Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
							ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew
							into the large-scale structures of the universe.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected
							evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized
							light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left
							over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves
							predicted by Einstein.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine a
							single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an
							even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation.
							And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of
							the original pot.
